here s something i ve learned about people we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don t know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the after effects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we ll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our well lit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and self preservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i ve been in the public eye since i was 15 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i ve been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it s 2017 and if you didn t see a picture of it it couldn t have happened right let me say it again louder for those in the back we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation

so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that s why i m still so in love with song writing so what i ve done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i ll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i d always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can t stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing 2 2014 10 27 139 1989 deluxe i know places voice memo uh uh uh oh oh oh oh i 3 2014 10 27 139 1989 deluxe i know places voice memo oh oh oh oh oh oh i 4 2014 10 27 139 1989 deluxe i know places voice memo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i i i 5 2014 10

prologue these songs were once about my life they are now about yours i was born in reading pennsylvania on december 13 1989 in the world we live in much is said about when we are born and when we die our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world and a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it but lately i ve been wondering what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death the moments when we are reborn the debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all i ever do is change all i ever do is learn from my mistakes so i don t make the same ones again then i make new ones i know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day every day i wake up as someone slightly new isn t it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new for the last few years i ve woken up every day not wanting but needing to write a new style of music i needed to change the way i told my stories and the way they sounded i listened to a lot of music from the decade in which i was born and i listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling i was also writing a different storyline than i d ever told you before i wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world the city i had always been overwhelmed by until now i think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on new york and all its blaring truth i wrote about the thrill i got when i finally learned that love to some extent is just a game of cat and mouse i wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle there is no riding off into the sunset like i used to imagine we are never out of the woods because we are always going to be fighting for something i wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever and how some feelings never go out of style i wrote about an important lesson i learned recently that people can say whatever they want about me but they can t make me lose my mind i ve learned how to shake things off i ve told you my stories for years now some have been about coming of age some have been about coming undone this is a story about coming into your own and as a result coming alive i hope you know that you ve given me the courage to change i hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be and that whispers behind your back don t define you you are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for from the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to new york or find happiness in a world where she is not in love love taylor 1 welcome to new york hidden message we begin our story in new york 2 blank space hidden message there once was a girl known by everyone and no one 3 style hidden message her heart belonged to someone who couldn t stay 4 out of the woods hidden message they loved each other recklessly 5 all you had to do was stay hidden message they paid the price 6 shake it off hidden message she danced to forget him 7 i wish you would hidden message he drove past her street each night 8 bad blood hidden message she made friends and enemies 9 wildest dreams hidden message he only saw her in his dreams 10 how you get the girl hidden message then one day he came back 11 this love hidden message timing is a funny thing 12 i know places hidden message and everyone was watching 13 clean hidden message she lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything deluxe 14 wonderland 15 you are in love 16 new romantics 17 i know places piano vocal voice memo 18 i wish you would track vocal voice memo 19 blank space guitar vocal voice memo

prologue speak now or forever hold your peace the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world right before the vows it s a last chance for protest a moment that makes everyone s heart race and a moment i ve always been strangely fascinated by so many fantasize about bursting into a church saying what they d kept inside for years like in the movies in real life it rarely happens real life is a funny thing you know in real life saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial so crucial in fact the most of us start to hesitate for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time but lately what i ve begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything i think most of us fear reaching the end of our life and looking back regretting the moments we didn t speak up when we didn t say i love you when we should ve said i m sorry when we didn t stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help these songs are made up of words i didn t say when the moment was right in front of me these songs are open letters each is written with a specific person in mind telling them what i meant to tell them in person to the beautiful boy whose heart i broke in december to my first love who i never thought would be my first heartbreak to my band to a mean man i used to be afraid of to someone who made my world very dark for a while to a girl who stole something of mine to someone i forgive for what he said in front of the whole world words can break someone into a million pieces but they can also put them back together i hope you use yours for good because the only words you ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone what you say might be too much for some people maybe it will come out all wrong and you ll stutter and you ll walk away embarrassed wincing as you play it all back in your head but i think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest so say it to them or say it to yourself in the mirror say it in a letter you ll never send or in a book millions might read someday i think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying i could ve but it s too late now there is a time for silence there is a time waiting your turn but if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say you ll know it i don t think you should wait i think you should speak now love taylor ps to all the boys who inspired this album you should ve known 1 mine hidden message toby 2 sparks fly hidden message portland oregon 3 back to december hidden message tay 4 speak now hidden message you always regret what you don t say 5 dear john hidden message loved you from the very first day 6 mean hidden message i thought you got me 7 the story of us hidden message cmt awards 8 never grow up hidden message i moved out in july 9 enchanted hidden message adam 10 better than revenge hidden message you thought i would forget 11 innocent hidden message life is full of little interruptions 12 haunted hidden message still to this day 13 last kiss hidden message forever and always 14 long live hidden message for you

according to my birth certificate i turn 30 this year it s weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283 but the actual age i currently am is 29 i ve heard people say that your thirties are the most fun so i ll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought i d share some lessons i ve learned before reaching 30 because it s 2019 and sharing is caring lesson 1 i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren t how you re failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way i m showing my friends and fans updates on my life but i m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look i m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while i m having my coffee at nine in the morning i think it s healthy for your self esteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once lesson 2 being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your life s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snake only bite if someone steps on you lesson 3 trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture you had to give me one moment of bitterness come on but that said it s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks it s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching that s good we ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now that s not what i said or do it whatever maybe you ll learn from it then you ll probably forget what you learned and do it again but it s fine do you you re searching lesson 4 i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day lesson 5 banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isn t cruel it s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it lesson 6 i ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we aren t allowed to age it s an impossible standard to meet and i ve been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we re supposed to defy gravity time and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn t even remotely required of men lesson 7 my biggest fear after the manchester arena bombing and the vegas concert shooting i was completely terrified to go on tour this time because i didn t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months there was a tremendous amount of planning expense and effort put into keeping my fans safe my fear of violence has continued into my personal life i carry quikclot army grade bandage dressing which is for gunshot or stab wounds websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address i ve ever had online you get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things every day i try to remind myself of the good in the world the love i ve witnessed and the faith i have in humanity we have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears lesson 8 i learned not to let outside opinions establish the value i place on my own life choices for too long the projected opinions of strangers affected how i viewed my relationships whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture i posted on instagram that stuff isn t real for an approval seeker like me it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my own value system of what i actually want lesson 9 i learned how to make some easy cocktails like pimm s cups aperol spritzes old fashioneds and mojitos because 2016 lesson 10 i ve always cooked a lot but i found three recipes i know i ll be making at dinner parties for life ina garten s real meatballs and spaghetti i just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat nigella lawson s mughlai chicken and jamie oliver s chicken fajitas with molé sauce getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer i also learned how to immediately calculate celsius to fahrenheit in my head which is what i m pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex lesson 11 recently i discovered command tape and i definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if i d hung things that way all along this is not an ad i just really love command tape lesson 12 apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you even if it was unintentional it s so easy to just apologize and move on try not to say i m sorry but and make excuses for yourself learn how to make a sincere apology and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships lesson 13 it s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault i believe the victim coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through i know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing awful experience i believe victims because i know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying this happened to me it s something no one would choose for themselves we speak up because we have to and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don t lesson 14 when tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you ve never dealt with before it s okay to say that you don t know what to say sometimes just saying you re so sorry is all someone wants to hear it s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them you don t have all the answers however it s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour your support is all someone needs when they re at their lowest point even if you can t really help the situation it s nice for them to know that you would if you could lesson 15 vitamins make me feel so much better i take l theanine which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety i also take magnesium for muscle health and energy lesson 16 before you jump in headfirst maybe i don t know get to know someone all that glitters isn t gold and first impressions actually aren t everything it s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what i know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them i call it a solid first 15 but the layers of a person you discover in time are they honest self aware and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it do they show up for you when you need them do they still love you after they ve seen you broken or after they ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they re people these are things a first impression could never convey lesson 17 after my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a sharpie as eyeliner do not do it i felt like i needed to start being nicer to my skin i now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after i shower not just in the winter but all year round because why can t i be soft during all the seasons lesson 18 realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them for example never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me even as an adult i still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at in my twenties i found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend so i shouted it from the rooftops posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood without realizing that other people might still feel the way i did when i felt so alone it s important to address our long standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them lesson 19 playing mind games is for the chase in a real relationship or friendship you re shooting yourself in the foot if you don t tell the other person how you feel and what could be done to fix it no one is a mind reader if someone really loves you they want you to verbalize how you feel this is real life not chess lesson 20 learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships something about we re in our young twenties hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family and maybe they will be for the rest of your life or maybe they ll just be your comrades for an important phase but not forever it s sad but sometimes when you grow you outgrow relationships you may leave behind friendships along the way but you ll always keep the memories lesson 21 fashion is all about playful experimentation if you don t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe you re doing it wrong see bleachella lesson 22 how to fight fair with the ones you love chances are you re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren t trying to hurt you if you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from there s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight i know a couple who in the thick of a fight say hey same team find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built they don t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship they just give out divorce papers lesson 23 i learned that i have friends and fans in my life who don t care if i m canceled they were there in the worst times and they re here now the fans and their care for me my well being and my music were the ones who pulled me through the most emotional part of the reputation stadium tour for me was knowing i was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up i ll never forget the ones who stuck around lesson 24 i ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family both of my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again it s taught me that there are real problems and then there s everything else my mom s cancer is a real problem i used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs i give all of my worry stress and prayers to real problems now lesson 25 i remember people asking me what are you gonna write about if you ever get happy there s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art that art and suffering go hand in hand i m really grateful to have learned this isn t true finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool lesson 26 i make countdowns for things i m excited about when i ve gone through dark low times i ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app they re free and adding things i m looking forward to even if they re not big holidays or anything it s good to look toward the future sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now and it s good to get some perspective that life will always go on to better things lesson 27 i learned that disarming someone s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh in my experience i ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously a few years ago someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet the fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than i ve ever felt in my life but i can t tell you how hard i had to keep from laughing every time my 63 foot inflatable cobra named karyn appeared onstage in front of 60 000 screaming fans it s the stadium tour equivalent of responding to a troll s hateful instagram comment with lol it would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us but maybe all i ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing i could survive it and thrive in spite of it lesson 28 i m finding my voice in terms of politics i took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day to day life i saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk and felt like i had to speak up to try and help make a change only as someone approaching 30 did i feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what i want from our leaders and i realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric i m going to do more to help we have a big race coming up next year lesson 29 i learned that your hair can completely change texture from birth i had the curliest hair and now it is straight it s the straight hair i wished for every day in junior high but just as i was coming to terms with loving my curls they ve left me please pray for their safe return lesson 30 my mom always tells me that when i was a little kid she never had to punish me for misbehaving because i would punish myself even worse i d lock myself in my room and couldn t forgive myself as a five year old i realized that i do the same thing now when i feel i ve made a mistake whether it s self imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating i ve come to a realization that i need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice trusting the wrong person or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone step into the daylight and let it go

verse 1 it s strange to think the songs we used to sing the smiles the flowers everything is gone yesterday i found out about you even now just looking at you feels wrong pre chorus you say that you d take it all back given one chance it was a moment of weakness and you said yes chorus you should ve said no you should ve gone home you should ve thought twice fore you let it all go you should have known the word bout what you did with her d get back to me and i should ve been there in the back of your mind i shouldn t be asking myself why you shouldn t be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should ve said no baby and you might still have me verse 2 you can see that i ve been crying baby you know all the right things to say but do you honestly expect me to believe we could ever be the same pre chorus you say that the past is the past you need one chance it was a moment of weakness and you said yes chorus you should ve said no you should ve gone home you should ve thought twice fore you let it all go you should ve known the word bout what you did with her d get back to me and i should ve been there in the back of your mind i shouldn t be asking myself why you shouldn t be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should ve said no baby and you might still have me bridge i can t resist before you go tell me this was it worth this was she worth this no no no no no no chorus you should ve said no you should ve gone home you should ve thought twice fore you let it all go you should ve known the word bout what you did with her d get back to me and i should ve been there in the back of your mind i shouldn t be asking myself why you shouldn t be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should ve said no baby and you might still have me
paul there s no big fancy introduction i don t think we really need one we just start talking taylor i mean yeah we could do that we could do that right yeah i mean did you have a fancy introduction planned no did you have a song prepared do we really well funny you should mention no no song no song prepared that s not gonna not at all and i came all the way to canada focusing on the year 1989 it was a great year do you know what the best picture that year was i do not the movie that won best picture in 1989 rain man amazing good movie right fantastic good movie the album of the year do you know the that won a grammy it s the first time that this has happened really to you yeah in an interview about an album called 1989 well i just figured you d just want to show off your knowledge well it s the internet it s not really showing off okay george michael s faith amazing album of the year this is actually educational it s pretty good right but i was happy that it wasn t like there weren t too sketchy things those were really good things that stand up rain man is still great to watch faith is still a fantastic album like a prayer by madonna came out in 1989 one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time you were born i was in 1989 for two weeks yeah that s okay that s okay but it still happened in that year it happened in 1989 you ve only released a studio album four times previous to this so this is something that doesn t happen to you all that often so the title of it it s really important the theme of it is really important right when was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989 actually no one this is why i like talking to you because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question it s actually a really interesting moment i remember exactly when i decided that i was gonna call it 1989 it was the night of the grammys this year after the grammys i didn t go to any afterparties or anything i kind of wanted to go home and eat in n out burger with my friends i remember going home and playing a lot of the new music i had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends we were all sitting in the kitchen and i was playing them all this music and they were just saying you know this is very eighties it s very clear to us that this is so eighties we were just talking and talking about how it s kind of a rebirth in a new genre how that s a big bold step how kind of starting a part of your career over when they left that night i just had this very clear moment of it s gotta be called 1989 it s gotta be called that we re talking about creative rebirth my birth year the album is eighties influenced i didn t know i was doing that but i was doing that you didn t know you were doing that i didn t mean to do it i just was doing it and so then after that i really was able to focus on the kind of eighties sonic concept and then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project were you still writing songs in the traditional way with a guitar yes and no i mean some of them i wrote on piano some of them i wrote on guitar some of them i would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co writers and say do you think this would sound cool like without words just singing the kind of synth line yeah or singing a drum beat over top of it and i would send it to them and i d go i don t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house i just have a piano and a guitar but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what i think the bassline should be and we can start there or it would be a first line of a first verse or it would be sort of an image that i wanted to create a feeling around we would just start with this image i had or a story it was a lot different than making any of my other albums it was yeah biggest difference was what the biggest difference was that i didn t have any i didn t have any boundaries around me production wise you know one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories coming up in the nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that could ve ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very um very detailed personal details but also some kind of like poetic purple imagery i love kind of i love how it all came about with my career but at this point it felt like i wanted to go and run in a direction that i had never run in before which was i wanna be able to use whatever instruments i want whatever drum sounds i want whatever vocal stylings i want i want to build and layer things and i don t want someone to say well this isn t country you know and for me to be trying to prove that it was so the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because i was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasn t in the genre it was supposed to be in so in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was you know when you make a pop album nobody s gonna look at it and say well that s not pop so i didn t have any restraints on me jason aldean recently said something about how you re not gonna hear him writing a song about being a wall street stock broker because he doesn t even know where wall street s at and that was the he s gotta know where that is i think he it s in new york that s where he keeps his money he s gotta know he knows where it s at i think he was trying to say just why i get what he s trying to say though sorry i was just like my dad is a stock broker who would ve just been like his brain would be like brain exploding gestures i understand that that s his life and talking about this is where i grew up what i grew up knowing what you grew up knowing is much different it s international yeah it s the world you ve been traveling the world for a long time i completely understand what he was saying there because i mean with me it s the same thing it s like as my life has changed i need to continue to write about it and i need to continue to write about even the things that change like moving to new york and you know focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends like these are things that are kind of the focal point of this new album and as much of when i was in high school i would sing about what my life was which was you know sneaking out at night and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend and falling in love and that kind of innocent summer romance thing small towns dirt roads that was actually my life in high school it s not anymore so if i were to continue to write songs about that i feel like it would be very disingenuous and as a songwriter that s the exact opposite of the goal i m trying to accomplish in listening to the songs i ve heard already they re still they re very much story songs you tell a story in each one there s a beginning a middle and an end and that s something that you focus on definitely i mean i think that s kind of engrained in me and that s the one part of my songwriting that i don t think should change as everything else does i think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years and getting that album and going oh this is what she s been through the last two years i meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye but not quite like there s nobody in the public eye like you there s a few on the planet and there s nothing that could prepare you for that am i right there s nothing in life that could prepare you for that i feel really lucky because i don t feel like i was shot out of a cannon you know a lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere and all of a sudden they have a triple platinum single and there s all this anticipation about their album and then all of a sudden people start to tear them down and it all happens over the course of six months to a year my career build i mean we re going on it s about nine years now since i put out my first album the record label was signed in 2005 right the record deal rather sorry we re going on almost ten years so it s been a really really gradual arc and that doesn t mean that sometimes it doesn t feel that it s at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it i feel like time has kind of prepared me for it i mean some days i wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is it s not normal to have security with you wherever you go it s not normal to have assistants it s not normal to have hair and makeup every day it s not normal to give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of new york that cat loves being held like that i know no i know but you can t do anything without somebody at some point on some website well the cat doesn t this isn t right for the cat to be out like that the cat loves it the cat here s the thing is that olivia yeah that s olivia yeah you re right exactly and when everything that you do is debated upon scrutinized questioned everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything there are days where i feel really really okay with that honestly but then there are days where i just am kind of overwhelmed by all of it and i think that that s okay i try to encourage my fans that they don t have to feel confident every day they don t have to feel happy every day they don t have to feel pretty every day they don t have to wanted every day that they shouldn t put added extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when they re not you know i think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important when you signed that record deal in 2005 is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out i mean it s obviously all worked out okay what advice are you gonna give to somebody like that i don t think i d wanna give her too much advice i would oh i think i would tell her to laugh more just you know if you laugh at yourself first it s less funny when other people make fun of you i would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism because i didn t know it when i was younger i think those are two important things for girls to know going into this business or going into life itself but all the other things all the really intense times i felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment those have all produced the songs i m the most proud of there was this crazy circumstance that happened where i wrote this song mean about the harshest criticisms i ve ever gotten it was brutal and that song ended up winning two grammys spectacular yeah in hindsight you don t but if you knew something was coming if someone said to you there s something coming around the corner it s brutal you re gonna want to you know hoodie for three weeks you re never gonna want to deal with it but the result will be album of the year oh my god you d do anything for that fair enough like i said earlier this is one of the things you don t get to do all the time you get to go on stage a lot you get to be interviewed a lot all of these things happen to you but album releases don t happen a lot they don t they don t happen a lot i m really soaking it in yeah do you still get as excited i know you were saying you re more proud of this than any of them yeah i m so excited i mean honestly because having spent the last year and a half just kind of living my life on my own terms and not not dating not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album i wanted to make there s such an incentive for me like i m so proud of it and i ve always been proud of my albums but there s something about this one where i feel like i actually did something different this time i actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something i was so focused on and i can be focused on my fans and i can you know like i m not tired right now during this interview like i m not distracted i m just kind of i m just really taking it in the highs that you get on stage almost nobody gets to experience what you experience on stage which again on the planet you have one of those jobs that s very rare what s second to that what s the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when you re on stage i would say it s different all the time but right now it s like seasonal stuff like i get as excited about being on stage as i get about cozy things because just the idea of seasons changing this is the time of year where i m so out of control excited about the fact that it s fall guess what s next winter yes so you re gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that it s two seasons that i love and i can bake stuff all the time and then i can give it to people i can try out new recipes i can wear sweaters i can wear knee socks i could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear okay i could do any of that because it s that kind of season but that s almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people you have to understand that if you re choosing your first place as being something like ahhhhhhh the second place has to be something that evens that out which is like baking day with your friends but your answer really is i don t need another high like that because that s the one i get by going on stage i think that is actually my revised answer you mentioned feminism you have almost by happy accident become a real icon for girls and women and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you is to kind of narrow down that definition or define the definition of feminism do you realize kind of how great that it is for young girls to see what you re doing i mean you get to experience that right when you talk to parents of young girls right that s awesome it s interesting because i think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having especially right now because with girls out there in the world living their lives knowing what it means is so important because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys they should be given equal opportunities and rights and i think the more people like lena dunham talk about it like lorde and emma watson talk about it and the fact that it s becoming sort of a conversation that is top of mind in the media i think it s so incredible i ve always made music so i could feel camaraderie with my fans not in a way that was trying to cater to kind of any male fantasy and that wasn t on purpose that s just been what has felt natural to me when asked early on about feminism in my career i just i think i was probably fifteen the first time i was asked about it and so i would just say i don t talk about politics i don t really understand that stuff yet so i guess i m just gonna say i m not and i wish that when i was younger i would ve known that it s simply hoping for gender equality probably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen year old about that you know that s an interesting point to make but i think that in the media it s very interesting to witness on a daily basis you know you go online and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on because we re curious and that s the society we live in but you ll see these polls like vote on who has a better butt this woman or this woman and you never see who has a better butt this man or this man it just never happens who s the hotter mama this woman or this woman it s not like who s the sexiest dad this man or this man you just don t see it and people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote and they think it s an innocent thing when really it s kind of warping your mind that you know and if a young girl logs on and votes it s like she s going oh my god if that girl in my class is pretty and smart then maybe everyone s comparing me to her and maybe i should hate her and that s just it s feeding this negativity and i really think that with girls kind of banding together in music in culture in movies whatever i think it s nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom and the playground and the campus and all that i know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults but it s not only adults who are seeing this stuff it s mostly not adults it s mostly not adults it s mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are and to warp their opinions of other girls that just adds anxiety to their life that they don t need this kind of brings me to talking about your legacy and i know i think five albums in it s appropriate to start talking a little bit about that i m guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make you release the things you take part in enough that they ll all be able to stand up not just to the test of time say sonically or whatever but that you can continue to be proud of this is that right yeah it s completely right it s dead on i ve always had this thing where i think about what if i m lucky enough to have grandkids someday what they would say if they looked back on pictures and videos and things like that and i d sure they d laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that but i would never want to embarrass them it s interesting because it s like the whole role model question like are you a role model do you think about the little kids in the front row when you re doing all the things you re doing in this life i think that s an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself but it s easier when you make it about your own life your own legacy when you kind of bring it in house and you re like what if i have a five year old someday and what if someday my ten year old goes online for the first time like what do i want her to see about me that s a pretty good way to look at it it s something that happens very naturally where if you re kind of just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions it s kind of a natural thing that happens where you know all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you and you re just sort of like hm well you re welcome where you were just kind of trying to live a good life because i think you know you don t want to feel like you re the national president of the babysitters club but you do wanna try to do good things and make ripples and good echoes in society and culture and all that but you are doing that and in the music that i ve heard already man are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this and experiencing it live it s great congratulations on this good thank you it s epic the album s out thank you it s great to talk to you as always as always thanks taylor awesome nice job thanks you re so good thank you thank you for doing this i always end up telling you stuff that i ve never thought to say in interviews
here s to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don t care about the he said she said here s to the moments when we ve forgotten all about the things that scare us the things we re insecure about and in spite of them we jumped around together under flashing lights fireworks and confetti to the times i learned by watching you sing along to every song that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me and that even in your worst times they can see the best in you here s to the musical family i get to share the stage with and all the things they ve sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing play and dance as well as they do here s to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you here s to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party here s to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust and brave enough to stay when it s hard or it s wrong or we re making mistakes here s to life teaching us lessons and us learning growing dancing and changing together everything i ve learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you i ve learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums thanks to you i m doing better than i ever was love taylor
chorus there s a girl that you want she s everything that i am not and you can t stop thinking about her there s a thin little line and it s like you cross it every time when you can t stop thinking about her

lyrics from taylor s inner circle a heart is drawn around your name in someone s handwriting not mine
verse 1 i would be complex i would be cool they d say i played the field before i found someone to commit to and that would be okay for me to do every conquest i had made would make me more of a boss to you pre chorus i d be a fearless leader i d be an alpha type when everyone believes ya what s that like chorus i m so sick of running as fast as i can wondering if i d get there quicker if i was a man and i m so sick of them coming at me again cause if i was a man then i d be the man i d be the man i d be the man verse 2 they d say i hustled put in the work they wouldn t shake their heads and question how much of this i deserve what i was wearing or if i was rude could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves pre chorus and they would toast to me oh let the players play i d be just like leo in saint tropez chorus i m so sick of running as fast as i can wondering if i d get there quicker if i was a man and i m so sick of them coming at me again cause if i was a man then i d be the man i d be the man i d be the man yeah bridge what s it like to brag about raking in dollars and getting bitches and models and it s all good if you re bad it s okay if you re mad if i was out flashing my dollars i d be a bitch not a baller they d paint me out to be bad so it s okay that i m mad chorus i m so sick of running as fast as i can wondering if i d get there quicker if i was a man you know that i m so sick of them coming at me again cause if i was a man then i d be the man i d be the man yeah yeah i d be the man yeah oh i d be the man i d be the man outro if i was a man then i d be the man

my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character s does it s something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment i m highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a long forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania i m clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco i m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe 2am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when i d get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey s anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds i m convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when i m writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you d think that as pop writers we re supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you d assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i don t mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 2009 in modern pop songs bops chunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artist s story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it s this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book
verse 1 we were in the backseat drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar i rent a place on cornelia street i say casually in the car we were a fresh page on the desk filling in the blanks as we go as if the street lights pointed in an arrow head leading us home chorus and i hope i never lose you hope it never ends i d never walk cornelia street again that s the kinda heartbreak time could never mend i d never walk cornelia street again and baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name and baby i m so terrified of if you ever walk away i d never walk cornelia street again i d never walk cornelia street again verse 2 windows flung right open autumn air jacket round my shoulders is yours we bless the rains on cornelia street memorize the creaks in the floor back when we were card sharks playing games i thought you were leading me on i packed my bags left cornelia street before you even knew i was gone pre chorus but then you called showed your hand i turned around before i hit the tunnel sat on the roof you and i chorus i hope i never lose you hope it never ends i d never walk cornelia street again that s the kinda heartbreak time could never mend i d never walk cornelia street again and baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name and baby i m so terrified of if you ever walk away i d never walk cornelia street again i ll never walk cornelia street again bridge you hold my hand on the street walk me back to that apartment years ago we were just inside barefoot in the kitchen sacred new beginnings that became my religion listen chorus i hope i never lose you i d never walk cornelia street again oh never again cause baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name and baby i m so terrified of if you ever walk away i d never walk cornelia street again i d never walk cornelia street again post chorus i don t wanna lose you i don t wanna lose you outro i rent a place on cornelia street i say casually in the car
lembrei desse sentimento gritando dentro de nós éramos todos meninos em cada um vivia uma paixão como uma cena de um filme vencemos pesadelos enfrentando os dragões criados por nossos medos fruto da imaginação de frente a uma nova era na onda de uma canção nós construímos a história mente alma e coração long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered i said remember this feeling i pass the pictures around of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines wishing for right now we are the kings and the queens you traded your baseball cap for a crown when they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town de frente a uma nova era na onda de uma canção nós construímos a história mente alma e coração long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i m not afraid long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you i was screaming long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall lembrei do momento que fiz promessa pra nós dois pintando o nosso destino puro e simples pleno e sem fim que fosse assim sem um goodbye fosse para sempre um cheguei os sonhos que construímos me vi feliz eu te achei será muito mais que achar será muito além de pensar long live the walls we crashed through i had the time of my life with you long long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you and i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i m not afraid singing long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you and long long live the look and your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered

the palm trees arrived in february seven in all set against a pastel blue backdrop with superimposed stars it appeared that a new taylor swift era was upon us that the old happy go lucky taylor was not in fact dead or did it it was only an instagram photo just one more picture in an infinite content scroll but it also came from a pop star known for prodigious hint dropping whose fans turn every piece of info into an online archaeological dig as expected the summery post sent swifties sifting through each detail with a fine tooth comb what did the trees symbolize an overdue vacation a recently purchased beach house a secret palm frond collection or maybe as many surmised it was new music one twitter user predicted that the number of stars in the background of the photo hinted at a single drop there s about 60 61 stars there s 61 days until april 26 friday a single release day another said it was the unofficial announcement of her next lp okay so in this picture there are 4 palm trees on the left 4 country albums there are two palm trees on the right 2 pop albums there is one large palm tree in the middle this represents her new album these may sound like ludicrous conspiracy theories for the record they were mostly correct but they fit firmly within the taylor swift musical universe it s like the marvel cinematic universe but with more guitars and fewer stan lee cameos i posted that the day that i finished the seventh album says swift about the photo i couldn t expect my fans to know that i figured they d figure it out later but a lot of their theories were actually correct those easter eggs were just trying to establish that tone which i foreshadowed ages ago in a spotify vertical video for delicate by painting my nails those pastel colors it s now april and the 29 year old pop star is in a los angeles photo studio giving her first sit down magazine interview in three years she wants to discuss the art of placing hints inside her work as well as the upcoming record which she recorded as soon as she finished the reputation tour she s also keen on detailing her own obsessions talking up the tv shows books and songs that help shape her outlook on life over the past 13 years swift has perfected the pop culture feedback loop she shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music which fans then gobble up and re promote with their own theories which swift then re shares on her tumblr or incorporates into future clues it s like a t swift built escher staircase of personal memories and moments that tease what s next i ve trained them to be that way she says of her fans astute detective work swift is a pop culture fanatic herself see the jean jacket she s wearing on the ew cover and has an innate understanding of the lengths her audience will go to be a part of the original creation i love that they like the cryptic hint dropping because as long as they like it i ll keep doing it it s fun it feels mischievous and playful through this approach swift has designed the ultimate artistic scavenger hunt and it s easy to get swept up in its drama even if you don t listen to her music her moments aren t always hidden either sometimes swift highlights aspects of her world just so fans feel like they re on the journey with her like the time in march 2018 when pop singer hayley kiyoko was accused of shading swift after mentioning her name during an interview on tumblr swift re shared a fan s post adding commentary that defended kiyoko which immediately dispelled any conflicts between the two artists swift s post subsequently received more than 29 000 notes four months later she invited kiyoko on stage during the reputation tour to sing her hit curious kiyoko returned the favor when she had swift join her that december at a benefit on behalf of the lgbtq organization the ally coalition to perform delicate fans of both artists were elated by the mutual support the feedback loop also extends outside of music in october 2018 swift broke her silence about politics by publicly endorsing two candidates for office in her adopted state of tennessee while encouraging her followers to register to vote she kept up the civic momentum through election day when she asked fans to post selfies after voting swift then eagerly re promoted her favorites on instagram stories this practice of sharing and re sharing and sharing again is why listeners consider swift one of the world s most accessible pop stars someone willing to not only interact with her audience but invite them to secret listening sessions or make the occasional surprise visit to their wedding or prom it s a symbiotic relationship one that as swift tells ew helped her dig out of the darker era of reputation it s definitely the fans that made that tonal shift in the way i was feeling she says songwriters need to communicate and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it reputation was interesting because i d never before had an album that wasn t fully understood until it was seen live when it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry upon listening to the whole thing they realized it s actually about love and friendship and finding out what your priorities are then during the reputation tour she had an epiphany that despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to i would look out into the audience and i d see these amazing thoughtful caring wonderful empathetic people she says so often with our takedown culture talking s about a celebrity is basically the same as talking s about the new iphone so when i go and i meet fans i see that they actually see me as a flesh and blood human being that as contrived as it may sound changed me completely assigning humanity to my life at tour s end she channeled that positive energy into the studio recording the new album in just under three months but the fast pace won t mean a short lp swift confirmed that her seventh record she hasn t announced a title yet the working nickname among fans is ts7 will include more songs than any of her previous releases i try not to go into making an album with any expectation she says i started to write so much that i knew immediately it would probably be bigger the project will also feature a mix of old and new collaborators on the candy coated lead single me swift brought in panic at the disco frontman brendon urie and coproducer joel little both of whom she had never worked with but she is unsurprisingly coy about doling out much more information as if doing so would break the carefully honed t swiftian feedback loop there s a lot of a lot on this album she says i m trying to convey an emotional spectrum i definitely don t wanna have too much of one thing you get some joyful songs and you get the bops as they say there s also she adds some really really really really sad songs but not enough to where you need to worry about me she gives us one more clue the true distinction between ts7 and reputation is in the delivery this time around i feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me once people delve into the album it ll become pretty clear that that s more of the fingerprint of this that it s much more of a singer songwriter personal journey than the last one the past month has seen a deluge of swift activity from the release of the new single to dropping more hints in interviews about the record and its title which is apparently hidden somewhere inside the me music video current fan guesses include kaleidoscope and daisy but if the easter eggs from the pop star seem like a business as usual routine she says this album does indeed mark a new era of her life where she s been better able to prioritize what s important to her our priorities can get messed up existing in a society that puts a currency on curating the way people see your life she says social media has given people a way to express their art i use it to connect with fans but on the downside you feel like there are 3 trillion new invisible hoops that you have to jump through and you feel like you ll never be able to jump through them all correctly i along with a lot of my friends and fans am trying to figure out how to navigate living my life and not just curating what i want people to think living my life is i m not always able to maintain a balance and i think that s important for everyone to know about we re always learning and that s something that i also had to learn that i ve got to be brave enough to learn learning in public is so humiliating sometimes do i feel more
