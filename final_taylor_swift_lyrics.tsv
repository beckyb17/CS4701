77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	Here's something I've learned about people.	0	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.	1	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.	2	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.	3	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?	4	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...	5	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.	6	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	There will be no further explanation.	7	2017-11-10
77	reputation	Reputation [Prologue] 	There will be just reputation.	8	2017-11-10

88	Red	Begin Again 	He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do	2	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	Turn the lock and put my headphones on	3	2012-09-25

88	Red	Begin Again 	[Chorus]	10	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid	11	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did	12	2012-09-25

88	Red	Begin Again 	Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end	14	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again	15	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	[Verse 2]	16	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	You said you never met one girl who	17	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do	18	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	We tell stories and you don't know why	19	2012-09-25

88	Red	Begin Again 	[Bridge]	27	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	And we walked down the block to my car	28	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	And I almost brought him up	29	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	But you start to talk	30	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	About the movies that your family watches	31	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that	32	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	And for the first time, what's past is past	33	2012-09-25
88	Red	Begin Again 	[Chorus]	34	2012-09-25

89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	Left a small town and never looked back	2	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling	3	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts	4	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	[Pre-Chorus 1]	5	2010-08-04

89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together	16	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	And there's a drawer of my things at your place	17	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded	18	2010-08-04

89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	Braced myself for the goodbye	39	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	'Cause that's all I've ever known	40	2010-08-04
89	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Mine 	Then, you took me by surprise	41	2010-08-04

122	Red	I Knew You Were Trouble (Intro) 	I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me.	0	2012-10-09
